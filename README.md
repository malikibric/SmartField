## 💡 Inspiration
**Smart Field** was inspired by the need to support **small farmers** who often lack access to advanced agricultural tools and real-time environmental data.  
We saw the potential of **AI** and **open satellite datasets** to revolutionize farming by making precision agriculture **accessible, sustainable, and practical** for everyone.

We were also motivated by the increasing challenges of **climate change**, which threaten crop yields and resource availability. Smart Field empowers farmers to **adapt and thrive** in changing environmental conditions.

## 🚀 What We Built
Smart Field is an **AI-powered precision agriculture platform** that uses open satellite imagery and environmental data from **NASA**, **NOAA**, and **ESA**.

👨‍🌾 Farmers can:
- 🌍 **Register and add their fields** by entering coordinates  
- 🧠 **Receive AI-driven recommendations and talk with AI** for irrigation, fertilization, and pest control  
- 🛰️ **View satellite-based maps** of soil health and vegetation  
- 📊 **Access dashboard** for real-time decision-making  

By promoting **sustainable farming practices**, Smart Field reduces environmental impact and supports climate resilience.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
We combined cutting-edge **web technologies**, **open data APIs**, and **AI models** to bring Smart Field to life:

| Layer | Technology / Tools |
|-------|--------------------|
| 🌐 Frontend | React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| ⚙️ Backend | Node.js, Express, Python |
| 🧭 Mapping | Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap |
| ☁️ Data Sources | NASA EarthData, NOAA Climate Data, ESA Copernicus - AWS Open Data|
| 🤖 AI Engine | Python ML models for environmental and crop insights |

Our architecture connects real-time open data streams with AI analysis to deliver actionable insights directly to farmers through an intuitive, visual interface.

---

## 🌾 How It Fits the Topic
Smart Field reduces inequalities by giving small farmers free access to AI and satellite data tools normally available only to large farms. By democratizing technology and focusing on climate resilience, it helps vulnerable communities adapt to climate change, improve crop yields, and strengthen economic stability.

---

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced
- Integrating **multiple open data APIs** (NASA, NOAA, ESA) into one seamless platform  
- Ensuring **AI-generated recommendations** were accurate and meaningful for diverse regions  
- Designing a **user-friendly frontend** that simplifies complex environmental data  
- Balancing **technical complexity** with ease of use for non-technical users  

---

## 📚 What We Learned
Throughout building Smart Field, we learned to:
- Handle **large-scale open datasets** efficiently  
- Create **intuitive UIs** for data visualization and AI interaction  
- Design systems that promote **social impact** and **sustainability**  
- Combine **AI, climate data, and user experience** into a single cohesive platform
